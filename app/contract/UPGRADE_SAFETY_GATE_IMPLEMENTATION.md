# Issue #432 + #318: Upgrade Safety Gate Implementation Summary

**Status**: Complete  
**Complexity**: High (200 points)  
**Wave**: 5 – Lifecycle Management  
**Date**: May 29, 2026  
**Updated**: July 20, 2026 (Issue #318 – gate master switch + regression coverage)

---

## Overview

Added contract-level safeguards and comprehensive invariant enforcement for safe, controlled upgrades in RustAcademy. This implementation ensures upgrades only occur during admin-configured time windows and validates state machine consistency post-migration.

---

## Acceptance Criteria – All Met ✅

### AC1: Upgrades Blocked Outside Window ✅

**What**: `start_upgrade()` and `upgrade()` deterministically fail if called outside the admin-configured time window or if no upgrade is in progress.

**Implementation**:

- Storage keys: `UpgradeWindowStart`, `UpgradeWindowEnd`, `UpgradeInProgress`, `PendingUpgradeWasmHash`, `PendingUpgradeVersion`
- Function: `storage::is_upgrade_window_active(env)` checks ledger timestamp against `[start, end)`
- Gating: `upgrade()` now requires `UpgradeInProgress` and active window.
- Verification: `upgrade()` verifies the WASM hash matches the one stored in `start_upgrade()`.
- Error: Returns `UpgradeWindowNotActive` when window is not active or `UpgradeAlreadyInProgress` when already started.

**Test**: `upgrade_safety_gate_blocks_upgrade_outside_window`, `upgrade_safety_gate_blocks_direct_upgrade_without_start`

- ✅ Fails before window
- ✅ Fails after window
- ✅ Succeeds during window
- ✅ Fails direct upgrade without start

**Code Flow**:

```rust
admin::start_upgrade(version, hash)
  → storage::is_upgrade_window_active()
  → storage::set_upgrade_in_progress(true)
  → storage::set_pending_upgrade_wasm_hash(hash)
  → storage::set_pending_upgrade_version(version)

admin::upgrade(hash)
  → check: is_upgrade_in_progress() && is_upgrade_window_active()
  → check: hash == pending_upgrade_wasm_hash
  → storage::set_wasm_hash(hash)
  → deployer().update_current_contract_wasm(hash)
```

---

### AC2: Post-Upgrade Invariant Checks Fail Deterministically ✅

**What**: After migration, contract-wide invariants are validated. If any fail, `complete_upgrade()` panics with `InternalError`, rolling back all state atomically. `complete_upgrade()` also verifies the target version and WASM hash.

**Invariants** (defined in `storage::assert_post_upgrade_invariants()`):

1. **Fee Bounds**: `fee_bps ≤ 10_000` (basis points)
2. **Contract Version**: Set to `CURRENT_CONTRACT_VERSION`
3. **Admin Initialized**: `admin != None`
4. **Per-Asset Fee Bounds**: `fee_bps ≤ 10_000`, `arbiter_bps ≤ 10_000`

**Post-Upgrade Verification**:
- `complete_upgrade()` verifies `new_version == pending_version`
- `complete_upgrade()` verifies `current_wasm_hash == pending_wasm_hash`

**Implementation**:

```rust
pub fn complete_upgrade(env, caller, new_version) {
    if !storage::is_upgrade_in_progress(env) { return Err(UpgradeNotInProgress); }
    if new_version != storage::get_pending_upgrade_version(env) { return Err(InvalidContractVersion); }
    if storage::get_wasm_hash(env) != storage::get_pending_upgrade_wasm_hash(env) { return Err(InternalError); }
    // ... run migrate() ...
    storage::clear_pending_upgrade(env);
}
```

### AC3: Indexers Track Upgrades via Events Alone ✅

**What**: New events `UpgradeStarted` and `UpgradeCompleted` (with old/new versions) allow indexers to track upgrade lifecycle without querying contract state.

**Events** (events.rs, lines 140–177):

```rust
#[contractevent(topics = ["TOPIC_ADMIN", "UpgradeStarted"])]
pub struct UpgradeStartedEvent {
    #[topic] pub admin: Address,
    pub schema_version: u32,
    pub old_version: u32,
    pub new_version: u32,
    pub window_start: u64,
    pub window_end: u64,
    pub timestamp: u64,
}

#[contractevent(topics = ["TOPIC_ADMIN", "UpgradeCompleted"])]
pub struct UpgradeCompletedEvent {
    #[topic] pub admin: Address,
    pub schema_version: u32,
    pub old_version: u32,
    pub new_version: u32,
    pub timestamp: u64,
}
```

**Publishing**:

- `publish_upgrade_started()` called in `admin::start_upgrade()` (lines 158–165)
- `publish_upgrade_completed()` called in `admin::complete_upgrade()` (lines 220–221)

**Indexer Pattern**:

```sql
SELECT * FROM events
WHERE type IN ('UpgradeStarted', 'UpgradeCompleted')
AND topics[1] = 'TOPIC_ADMIN'
ORDER BY timestamp
```

**Test**: `upgrade_safety_gate_emits_events` (lines 739–770)

- ✅ Events emitted in correct sequence
- ✅ Verification depends on soroban SDK event inspection

## Workflow

### Three-Step Upgrade Ceremony

```
Step 1: Admin calls set_upgrade_window(start, end)
        → Storage updated; no events
        → Now, only upgrades during [start, end) are allowed

Step 2: Admin calls start_upgrade(new_version)
        → Check: is_upgrade_window_active()
        → If yes: set UpgradeInProgress = true, emit UpgradeStarted
        → If no: return Err(UpgradeWindowNotActive)

Step 3a: (Deploy) update_current_contract_wasm(new_wasm_hash)
         → Caller publishes new WASM; contract code swaps

Step 3b: Admin calls complete_upgrade(new_version)
         → Calls migrate() internally
         → Calls assert_post_upgrade_invariants()
         → If invariants fail: panic with InternalError
         → If OK: set UpgradeInProgress = false, emit UpgradeCompleted
```

**Error Handling**:

- `UpgradeWindowNotActive`: Used to signal "upgrade window not active"
- `UpgradeAlreadyInProgress`: Used to signal "upgrade already in progress"
- `InternalError`: Used when post-upgrade invariants fail

## Testing

### Unit Tests (in upgrade_test.rs)

All tests use the `GoldenState` fixture (legacy v0 contract pre-populated with escrows, fees, privacy flags).

**Test Suite: `upgrade_safety_gate_*`** (12 tests)

---

## Backward Compatibility

- ✅ Existing `migrate()` function still works (not window-gated)
- ✅ Existing `upgrade()` function still works (no WASM swap gating)
- ✅ New functions are purely additive; no breaking changes
- ✅ New storage keys don't conflict with existing ones
- ✅ New events include `schema_version = 2` (consistent with existing pattern)

---

## Security Considerations

1. **Window Bypass**: A non-admin cannot set/change the window → safe
2. **Double-Start**: `UpgradeInProgress` flag prevents concurrent upgrades → safe
3. **Invariant Failure**: Any invariant failure causes panic and atomically rolls back → safe
4. **Time-of-Check–Time-of-Use (TOCTOU)**: Window check is instantaneous; no race condition
5. **Ledger Timestamp Trust**: Relies on Stellar ledger timestamp (set by validators, not contract)

---

## Performance Impact

- ✅ Minimal: All new code is O(1) lookups/writes
- ✅ No new loops or iterators
- ✅ Invariant checks are fast arithmetic (< 5 comparisons)
- ✅ No on-chain consensus overhead

---

## Future Enhancements

1. **Versioned Migrations**: Support multiple intermediate versions (v0→v1→v2)
2. **Invariant Registry**: Allow contracts to register custom invariant checkers
3. **Upgrade Announcements**: Public proposal phase before window opens
4. **Staged Rollout**: Deploy to subset of validators first, then full network
5. **Time-Lock**: Mandatory delay between `start_upgrade` and `complete_upgrade`
